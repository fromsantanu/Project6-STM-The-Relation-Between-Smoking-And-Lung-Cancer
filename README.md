> **Brief Description:** Correlation between Smoking and chances of Lung Cancer

![Project Logo](STMProjects.png)

The program generates and plots a scatter plot to illustrate the relationship between the average number of cigarettes smoked per day and the incidence of lung cancer. Here's what the plot communicates in layman's terms:

### Plot Overview:
1. **Scatter Plot**:
   - The scatter plot shows data points representing individuals' average daily cigarette consumption and whether they have lung cancer.

### Key Points:
1. **Data Points**:
   - Each point represents an individual.
   - The x-axis shows the average number of cigarettes smoked per day.
   - The y-axis shows whether the individual has lung cancer (1 for cancer, 0 for no cancer).

2. **Correlation Coefficient**:
   - The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer.
   - A strong positive correlation means that as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increases, the likelihood of lung cancer also increases.

3. **Trendline**:
   - The red line represents the general trend in the data, showing the relationship between smoking and lung cancer incidence.

### Interpretation:
- **Relationship Between Smoking and Lung Cancer**:
  - The scatter plot shows that individuals who smoke more cigarettes per day are more likely to have lung cancer.
  - The strong positive correlation indicates a significant relationship between higher cigarette consumption and lung cancer incidence.

### In Layman's Terms:
The plot visually explains the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Each dot represents a person, showing how many cigarettes they smoke daily and whether they have lung cancer.

- People who smoke more cigarettes per day (dots further to the right) are more likely to have lung cancer (dots higher up).
- The red trendline helps to see this relationship clearly, showing that as smoking increases, so does the chance of getting lung cancer.

This plot helps to understand that smoking more cigarettes per day is strongly associated with a higher risk of lung cancer.
